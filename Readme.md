# Tamil Handwritten Character Recognition Model
## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model for recognizing handwritten Tamil characters using deep learning. The dataset consists of offline handwritten Tamil characters with 156 unique characters. The model is designed to classify and recognize these characters accurately.
<br>
## Dataset

This [Dataset](https://lipitk.sourceforge.net/datasets/tamilchardata.htm) contains 500 examples of each of the 156 Tamil characters. The images are preprocessed by converting to PNG format, resizing to 32x32 pixels, and normalizing pixel values. 

### Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the Model

```
python main.py
```

### Results
The model achieves over 90% accuracy on the test set, showing strong performance in recognizing Tamil handwritten characters.
